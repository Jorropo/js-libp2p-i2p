> JavaScript implementation of the I2P module for libp2p. It exposes the [interface-transport](https://github.com/libp2p/interface-connection) for dial/listen. `libp2p-tcp` is a very thin shim that adds support for dialing to a `multiaddr`. This small shim will enable libp2p to use other different transports.

This module is in WIP and not even working, code is just from js-libp2p-tcp and need to be changed.

It was templated on [js-libp2p-tcp](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-tcp).

## Usage

WIP

## API

### Transport

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libp2p/interface-transport/master/img/badge.png)](https://github.com/libp2p/interface-transport)

`libp2p-tcp` accepts TCP addresses both IPFS and non IPFS encapsulated addresses, i.e:

`/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001`
`/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmHash`

Both for dialing and listening.
